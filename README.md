In Roulette Trivia two oponents go up against each other to see who has the most knowledge. The first one to get 10 points wins the
game and gets bragging rights FOREVER!

Technology used in this game includes HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery.

The design approach was inspired from the 1920's era with a Paris theme.

Problems that I would like to resolve are my alert boxes would like to incorprate them to the theme. I would also like to disable
the trivia questions after they have been answered so they won't repeat.
